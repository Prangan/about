      <h2>The competition</h2>
      <p>The second main part of the event is a Business competition, this competition requires applicants to develop a business idea, i.e. a product, service or company and requires students to submit descriptions of the idea through a form (e.g. forms.google.com). Students can apply either individually or in teams and must be in high school.</p>
      <p>The competition aims to spur the student bodyâ€™s interest in entrepreneurship, while teaching the participants skills required to create a business. The best way to do this is putting them in the shoes of an entrepreneur and making them go through the thinking process of creating and developing a viable business model. </p>
      <p>The minimum information applicants must submit is a completed business model canvas (example: here). However developing the idea further and providing supplementary material is strongly recommended (I.e. a concept video, website, marketing campaign structure etc.)</p>
      <p>The competition itself will be launched in September to provide adequate time for applicants to generate and develop their ideas. The idea will be judged on several aspects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus</li>
        <li>Initial Investment</li>
        <li>Originality</li>
        <li>Viability</li>
        <li>Disruptiveness/Impact</li>
        <li>Predicted growth</li>
        <li>Consumer Acceptance</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Who can apply?</h2>
      <p>Our main target audience is the students from the Sevenoaks area. However, if we do receive applications from schools outside Sevenoaks we will accept them as long as the team is willing to travel to the school if they qualify for the final.</p>
      <h2>Timing</h2>
      <p>The competition is going to be launched in September. Deadlines for the first applications will be around November. The applications will then be screened over winter, and the top 10 teams will pitch their ideas at the event.</p>
      <h2>Give me more content!</h2>
      <p>I am going to need some more content to finish this page, as I do not know enough about the competition myself!</p>
